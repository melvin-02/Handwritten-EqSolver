# Handwritten-EqSolver
Evaluate any handwritten arithmetic math equation using only its picture
The picture should be as follows:  
  1.Written in - "black"    
  2.Background - "white"  
  
### I have not used the MNIST dataset as it only contains the digits. I used a different dataset form kaggle. I have provided the dataset used 

### Numbers.zip contains the whole balanced dataset  
### Numbers_CNN is the notebook to train a CNN model to recognise the images  
### Math Eqs is the notebook that contains the implementation
